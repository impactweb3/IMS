# Impact Measurement System (IMS) Requirements Summary

## Overview
The Impact Measurement System (IMS) is designed for Project Catalyst (PC) to measure and track the impact of funded projects across various dimensions. The system aims to integrate with Cardano's ecosystem while being compatible with other blockchain technologies.

## Architecture Aims
- Create an IMS that easily integrates into Project Catalyst and functions as a standalone system for external organizations
- Design a user-friendly interface with straightforward forms and questions
- Align with Project Catalyst's simple application and reporting processes

## Core Objectives
- Embed Scalability, Interoperability, and Sustainability into the IMS
- Ensure the IMS captures impacts related to People, Purpose, Technology, Research, and Opportunity
- Collect data on social, economic, environmental, and governance impacts
- Develop a flexible system that scales with ecosystem growth
- Use open standards and APIs to facilitate integration with other platforms
- Include mechanisms for feedback and refinement
- Provide clear and accessible impact data
- Ensure the IMS is lightweight and resource-efficient
