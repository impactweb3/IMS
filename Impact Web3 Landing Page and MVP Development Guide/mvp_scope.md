# Impact Web3 MVP Prototype Scope

## Overview
The Impact Web3 MVP (Minimum Viable Product) will demonstrate the core functionality of the Impact Measurement System (IMS) for blockchain projects. The MVP will focus on providing a functional prototype that showcases the key features of the system while being simple enough to implement quickly.

## Core Features

### 1. Data Collection Module
- **Application Form**: Digital form for projects to submit initial impact goals and metrics
- **Reporting Form**: Digital form for projects to report actual impact achievements
- **Basic API**: Simple endpoints for data submission and retrieval

### 2. Data Analysis Module
- **Metrics Processing**: Basic processing of submitted metrics
- **Impact Categorization**: Categorization of impacts into social, environmental, economic, and governance
- **Simple Trend Analysis**: Basic visualization of impact trends over time

### 3. Reporting Module
- **Dashboard**: Visual representation of impact metrics
- **Export Functionality**: Ability to export reports in common formats (CSV, PDF)
- **Public View**: Simplified public view of aggregated impact data

### 4. Blockchain Integration
- **Cardano Integration**: Basic integration with Cardano blockchain for data verification
- **Midnight Compatibility**: Framework for future Midnight blockchain integration
- **EVM Compatibility Layer**: Simple adapter for EVM compatibility

## Technical Components

### Frontend
- **User Interface**: Clean, responsive interface for data input and visualization
- **Forms**: Interactive forms with validation for data collection
- **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs for impact data representation
- **Dashboard**: Admin and public dashboards for data exploration

### Backend
- **API Server**: RESTful API for data submission and retrieval
- **Database**: Schema for storing impact measurement data
- **Authentication**: Basic user authentication and authorization
- **Data Processing**: Simple algorithms for data analysis and categorization

### Blockchain Components
- **Data Verification**: On-chain verification of impact claims
- **Compatibility Layer**: Adapters for different blockchain technologies
- **Smart Contract Templates**: Basic templates for impact verification

## User Roles
- **Project Proposers**: Submit impact goals and report on achievements
- **Evaluators**: Review and validate impact claims

- Simplified user interface without extensive customization options
- Manual verification processes for some impact claims
- Limited historical data analysis

## Success Criteria
- Functional data collection through application and reporting forms
- Accurate categorization of impacts into the four main categories
- Visual representation of impact metrics on dashboards
- Basic blockchain integration for data verification
- Ability to export and share impact reports
- Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility
- Positive user feedback on usability and functionality

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Advanced analytics and machine learning for impact prediction
- Comprehensive blockchain integration with smart contracts
- Automated verification of impact claims
- Customizable dashboards and reporting
- Integration with external data sources
- Mobile application for on-the-go reporting
- Community governance features for system evolution
